The 6th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data will take place on March 25th, 2019, in Dresden, Germany, and is co-located with the [EuroSys 2019 conference][eurosys19]. It is a successor to previous workhops in this series, [PaPeC 2014][papec14], [PaPoC 2015][papoc15], [PaPoC 2016][papoc16], [PaPoC 2017][papoc17], and [PaPoC 2018][papoc18] which brought together researchers and practitioners in the areas of distributed systems, programming languages, databases and concurrent programming.

This workshop aims to investigate the principles and practice of available consistency models for large-scale, distributed shared data systems. This includes cloud-based systems, geo-replicated systems, and systems that combine cloud and edge components. It will bring together theoreticians and practitioners from different horizons: system development, distributed algorithms, concurrency, fault tolerance, databases, language and verification, including both academia and industry. The Call for Papers for PaPoC 2019 is available, please [consider submitting your work][easychair].
